# Realtime-Face-Mask-Detection
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a worldwide emergency in healthcare. This virus mainly spreads through droplets which emerge from a person infected with coronavirus and poses a risk to others. The risk of transmission is highest in public places. One of the best ways to stay safe from getting infected is wearing a face mask in open territories as indicated by the World Health Organization (WHO). In this project, we propose a method which employs TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect face masks on people. A bounding box drawn over the face of the person describes weather the person is wearing a mask or not.
